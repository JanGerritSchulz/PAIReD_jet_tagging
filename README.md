# PAIReD jet tagging framework
A repository combining the full workflow of PAIReD tagger development.

## Introduction
PAIReD jets are new types of jets for improved reconstruction of hadronic decays of heavy objects such as the Higgs boson. This repository deals with the creation of a PAIReD tagger to classify these newly defined jets. From the production of PAIReD data sets to the training of a neural network and its testing, everything will be covered in this repository.

## Getting started: Recipe for the PAIReD training workflow
The individual steps of the workflow required to obtain a PAIReD tagger are described here in several chapters:
1. [Production of data sets](doc/workflow-recipe/production-datasets.md)
2. [Training a PAIReD tagger]()
3. [Evaluation of tagger performance]()
